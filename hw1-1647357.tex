  \section{Introduction}
  Due to the continuous increasing of computational power, every encryption algorithm will eventually become obsolete.
  Any algorithm for which a bruteforce attack is computationally feasible, is considered weak, and must not be used. In this article we present an analysis on the bruteforce attack against such an algorithm as DES, for which we provide an implementation and performance results.

  \section{Resources Used}
  To test the implementation a 2 GHz Intel Core i5 (dual core, with 4 virtual cores thanks to hyperthreading) with 16 GB of RAM has been used.
